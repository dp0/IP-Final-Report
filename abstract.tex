	\noindent The project addresses the lack of anonymous P2P data storage networks offering a send-receive architecture by designing and implementing an API to such a network. 
	
	The implementation of the API revolves around the protocol which has been designed by considering intended use cases and the elements of protocol reflect this. The final protocol design focuses on the security of information, in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The network attempts to allow for predictable availability of packets through expiry dates in conjunction with a proof-of-work system to prevent abuse. The design takes into account anonymity, but does not implement it 
	
	\noindent As a result of the project, the implementation, named Stor, has been released under a BSD license.
