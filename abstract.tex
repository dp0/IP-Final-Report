	The project addresses the lack of anonymous P2P data storage networks offering a send-receive architecture by designing and implementing one.
	
	The implementation revolves around the protocol which is designed by considering multiple intended network use cases and designing the elements of protocol around these. The final protocol design focuses on the security of information, in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Packets in the network are only stored if accompanied with a valid proof-of-work to deter abuse. 
	
	To achieve anonymity, nodes are run as hidden services through Tor. 
	
	As a result of the project, the implementation, named Stor, has been released under a BSD license.
