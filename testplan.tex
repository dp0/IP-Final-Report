			Unit Test & Description & Pass/Fail \\ \hline
			
			\texttt{testGeneration} & Tests that a valid proof-of-work is generated so that it would be accepted. & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testFakeValidity} & A fake proof-of-work validity period is tested to ensure that it is not accepted. & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testFakeData} & A fake proof-of-work packet hash is tested to ensure that it is not accepted. & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testFakeProof} & Tests a fake proof-of-work nonce to ensure that it is not accepted. & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testCheckForMe} & Tests the method that checks for packet receipt on a packet that is for a held identity & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testCreationFromBase64} & Checks that identities can be created from a Base64 string & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testCreationFromBase64Integrity} & Tests the integrity of identities created from Base64 & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testSuccessfulDecryption} & A packet is encrypted and decrypted, checking that the message is unchanged & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testCheckNotForMe} & Tests the method that checks for packet receipt on a packet that is not for a held identity & Pass \\ \hline
			\texttt{testBroadcastGeneration} & Tests the protobuf for the serialisation/deserialisation of broadcasts & Pass \\ \hline

			\hline
			ID & Description & Expected Result & Possible Failures & Pass/Fail \\ \hline
			
			0 & Node reports failure if unable to connect to a local tor control connection. & Stor throws an exception, mentioning that a connection could not be made and explaining how to fix it. & Case not checked. \newline Exception not thrown. & Pass \\ \hline
			
			1 & New node creates a hidden service & Stor finds no existing hidden service and creates one using the control connection. Can be tested by establishing a connection to the hidden service through Tor. & Failure to detect no existing hidden service exists. \newline Hidden service is not created. & Pass \\ \hline
			
			2 & Read configuration and use parameters & Stor uses the configuration file to establish a secure control connection to the local tor instance. & Does not read config. \newline Does not use values in config. & Pass \\ \hline
