		% STATUS: Complete & Checked
		The primary objective of the system is to provide an API for a send-receive architecture, affording the sending and receipt of messages. The node implementation and abstract protocol are therefore designed around this objective.
		
		% STATUS: Complete & Checked
		The API is designed to revolve around two functions: send and receive. Sending requires knowledge of the public identity of the receiver; the message and how long it should be stored in the network. Receiving requires knowledge of a private identity, which returns a message for the given identity. Both functions are blocking, meaning that sending will block until the message is in the network and receiving will block until a message that has not been received previously is returned. Appendix \ref{uml-api} shows the general design for the API.
