\section{Design}
	\subsection{Considered Designs}
		Several key elements of a storage network were identified and different design decisions based around these elements were considered.
		
		General idea:
			A sender will perform some function on a message such that a receiver for that message can perform the inverse of the function to determine if the message is for them. In practice, these functions will likely be public key cryptographic functions.
		
		Information Distribution and Delivery
			Keep the system general
			Unless a loss in anonymity, everyone must check if a message is for them
			STREAMS!!! - mention dangers of these though...
			
		Node discovery and initial connection / connection topology.\\
		\input{internodal-connections}
		
			
		Inter-nodal connections
		Data storage
		Broadcast handling
		\subsubsection{Protocol}
			The protocol dictates how nodes interact with each other and how they should organise themselves.
			
			In some existing networks, such as Freenet, nodes organise themselves into a ``small-world topology'', where all nodes can connect to each other with a small number of hops. One of the reasons this is done in Freenet is to allow for 
	\subsection{Key Use Cases}
		-General Overview of How the System should be used
		\subsubsection*{Node Discovery}
			In order for a prospective node to connect to the network, it must have some method of finding additional nodes. 
			-Initial Node
			-List of Nodes
			-Check if nodes are connected
			-Periodic updating of 
		\subsubsection*{Data Insertion}
			-Determine what Proof of Work to use
			-Generate Proof of Work
			-Send to connected nodes
