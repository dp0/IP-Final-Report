	\subsection{API}
		The primary objective of the system is to provide an API that allows for sending and receiving of messages. The node implementation and protocol are therefore designed around this objective.
		
		The API is designed to revolve around 2 functions: send and receive. Sending requires knowledge of the public identity of the sender, the message and how long it should be stored in the network. Receiving requires knowledge of a private identity, which returns a message for the given identity. Both functions are blocking, meaning that sending will block until the message is in the network and receiving will block until a message that has not been received previously is returned. Figure \ref{fig:api-uml-design} shows the general design for the API.
