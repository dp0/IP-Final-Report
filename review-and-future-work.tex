\section{Review and Future Work}
	The project has been quite successful...
	Some things are yet to be implemented...
		Streams (for reasons)
		Some lower priority security mechanisms (zeroisation)
	...
	
	Future work could address some of these unimplemented features
	Could also look into addressing the issues with the network such as Sybil attacks
	
	An interesting future could see a large application that utilises the network made.
