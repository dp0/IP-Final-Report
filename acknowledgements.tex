\section*{\emph{Acknowledgements}\phantomsection}
	I would like to thank Dr.~Tim~Chown for accepting my project proposal and giving continued support. I would also like to express thanks to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Tor Project for inspiring me to pursue a project in an area of growing relevance. As a result of my interest in this area, I am now a Tor relay operator.
